# Lectures Repository - CSCI1360 Spring 2024

## Foundations for Informatics and Data Analytics

In this repository you can find each module slides in the form of Jupyter Notebook files. Only modules 0 and 1 have their slides as PDF files.

As we go through teaching materials, notebook files will be added continuously. Should you clone this repository to your laptop, pulling the updates to your local storage is necessary. You can perform that by running the following Git command `git pull` when your terminal is pointing at the cloned repository.

Remember using Piazza when you face any issue accessing the materials.
